# Hyperledger Avalon SDKs

This is a simple example package of Hyperledger Avalon SDK.

Hyperledger Avalon (formerly Trusted Compute Framework)
enables privacy in blockchain transactions,
moving intensive processing from a main blockchain to improve scalability and
latency, and to support attested Oracles.

The Trusted Compute Specification was designed to help developers gain the
benefits of computational trust and to mitigate its drawbacks. In the case of
the Avalon, a blockchain is used to enforce execution
policies and ensure transaction auditability, while associated off-chain
trusted compute resources execute transactions. By using trusted off-chain
compute resources, a developer can accelerate throughput and improve data
privacy.

Preservation of the integrity of execution and the enforcement
of confidentiality guarantees come through the use of a Trusted Compute (TC)
option, e.g. ZKP (Zero Knowledge Proof), MPC (Multi Party Compute),
or a hardware-based TEE (Trusted Execution Environment).
While the approach will work with any TC option that guarantees integrity and
confidentiality for code and data, our initial implementation uses
Intel® Software Guard Extensions (SGX).

Hyperledger Avalon leverages the existence of a distributed ledger to
 * Maintain a registry of the trusted workers (including their attestation info)
 * Provide a mechanism for submitting work orders from a client(s) to a worker
 * Preserve a log of work order receipts and acknowledgments

Hyperledger Avalon uses the
[ _Off-Chain Trusted Compute Specification_](https://entethalliance.github.io/trusted-computing/spec.html)
defined by Enterprise Ethereum Alliance (EEA) Task Force as a starting point to
apply a consistent and compatible approach to all supported blockchains.
